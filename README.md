This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected code is provided in `bugSolution.java`, illustrating the proper way to iterate within the valid index range of an array.
